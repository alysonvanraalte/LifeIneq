\usage{
ineq_MAD(age, dx, lx, ex, ax, center_type = c("ex", "mean"))
}
\arguments{
\item{age}{numeric. vector of lower age bounds.}

\item{dx}{numeric. vector of the lifetable death distribution.}

\item{lx}{numeric. vector of the lifetable survivorship.}

\item{ex}{numeric. vector of remaining life expectancy.}

\item{ax}{numeric. vector of the average time spent in the age interval of those dying within the interval.}
}
\description{
Calculate a lifetable column for the conditional mean average deviation in lifetable ages at death
}
\details{
All input vectors must be the same length. Also, we recommend using input data from a life table by single year of age with a highest age group of at least age 110. If your data have a lower upper age bound, consider extrapolation methods, for instance a parametric Kannisto model (implemented in \code{MortalityLaws::MortalityLaw}). If your data are abridged, consider first smoothing over age, and calculating a life table by single year of age (for instance by smoothing with a pclm model in package \code{ungroup} or with a penalized B-spline approach in package \code{MortalitySmooth}).

data(LT)
# A vector containing the conditional MAD in age at death 
M = ineq_MAD(age=LT$Age,dx=LT$dx,lx=LT$lx,ex=LT$ex,ax=LT$ax)
# The MAD in age at death from birth
M[1]
# The MAD in age at death conditional upon survival to age 10
M[11]
